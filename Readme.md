BlastOff is the perfect introduction to the mind-bogglingly thing we call space.
Explore topics such as the Milky Way galaxy, stars, and our solar system!
BlastOff goes beyond, with a Text-to-Speech feature to help kids who are learning
to read, and allows them to access the NASA Kids Club website to continue their space exploration!
